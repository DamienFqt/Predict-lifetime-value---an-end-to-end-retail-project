# About
This project serves two purposes:
- to showcase a complete end-to-end workflow for a typical retail problem, from the business problem to the model deployment and its monitoring;
- to strengthen practical skills in MLOps, best coding practices, and version control with Git.

It is based on a fictitious company - selling violette-based products (see below its logo) - and synthetic data whose process is clearly defined.

The final goal is to answer the business problem by deploying an application which can predict the top customers according to their lifetime value.

# Contents
It begins with the introduction of the retail context and setting the business problem before describing the data generating process. 

Then, the implementation steps are explained. 

Finally, a first sketch of the business problem's solution is shown followed by a list of potential improvments.

0. The business problem : a long-term loyalty program for the top clients according to their lifetime value
1. Data Generating Process
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Modeling
4. Deploying an application
5. Elements of solution, monitoring and future improvments


# Getting started


# Usage 
The interface allows you to modify :
- the number of top customers for whom you would like the lifetime value
- the model version

As a fictitious company's employee, you can then copy and paste the list of top customers and contact them.
