# About
This project serves two purposes:
- to showcase a complete end-to-end workflow for a typical retail problem;
- to strengthen practical skills in MLOps, best coding practices, and version control with Git.

It is based on a fictitious company - selling violette-based products (see below its logo) - and synthetic data whose process is clearly defined.

The final goal is to deploy an application which can predict the top customers according to their lifetime value

# Contents
It begins with the introduction of the retail context and setting the business problem before describing the data generating process. 

Then, the implementation steps are explained. 

Finally, a first sketch of the business problem's solution is shown followed by a list of potential improvments.

1. Data Generating Process
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Modeling
4. Deploying an application
5. Elements of solution and future improvments


# Getting started


# Usage 
The interface allows you to modify :
- the number of top customers for whom you would like the lifetime value
- the model version

As a fictitious company's employee, you can then copy and paste the list of top customers and contact them.
